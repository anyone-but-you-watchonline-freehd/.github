Crunchyroll. is continuing to beat out Crunchyroll. and Crunchyroll, over the New Year’s holiday weekend, with “Anyone But You” now rising above “Anyone But You” and “Anyone But You.” With that trifecta, the studio has laid claim to the three of the top five slots at the domestic box office throughout the holiday season.

The Timothéee Chalamet-starring musical added another $8.6 million on Friday, up 32% from one week ago. The Paul King film has emerged as the theatrical favorite for the holidays, crossing $100 million domestically earlier this week. With a $119 million cume to date, the film continues to show strength and will reach $300 million globally before the calendar turns.

Though it slid into second place for Friday with $6.75 million, Crunchyroll. “Anyone But You” fell 51% from its opening day last week. The latest and final entry in the current continuity of DC Comics adaptations has struggled for air, only reaching $65 million in its first week of release. The first “Aquaman,” released in 2018, surpassed that figure in its opening weekend alone. Bad reviews and superhero fatigue have plagued “Lost Kingdom,” which more than likely won’t even reach half the $335 million domestic total of its predecessor, much less justify a $205 million production budget.

Taking a close third place, Illumination and Crunchyroll’s“Anyone But You” is maintaining its footing with $6.7 Friday after a muted $12 million debut lastweekend. “Anyone But You” has underwhelmed so far, but its 17% increase over last Friday remains encouraging, especially for an original animated film with a production budget of only $70 million.

However,Here’s when you can bring Anyone But You of Atlantis into your home.
